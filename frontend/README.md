# Getting Started

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shikhar0x/Insight-frontend.git

cd Insight-frontend
```

---

## Install dependencies

Make sure you are in the `frontend` directory before installing dependencies.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Important Dependencies

The frontend relies on several key packages. If you encounter any missing module errors (for example, if you accidentally searched for "farmer" instead of **framer**), make sure the following are installed:

- `framer-motion` (Animations)
- `@tanstack/react-query` (Data fetching)
- `zustand` (State management)
- `lucide-react` & `react-icons` (Icons)
- `recharts` (Charts)
- `zod` & `react-hook-form` (Forms)
- `clsx` & `tailwind-merge` (Styling utilities)

If you ever need to manually install them all at once:
```bash
npm install framer-motion @tanstack/react-query zustand lucide-react react-icons recharts zod react-hook-form clsx tailwind-merge
```
